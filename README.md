# OverBoost

### ðŸŽ® About ðŸŽ®
**OverBoost** is an ongoing project that I am using to both learn and demonstrate new skills. Closer to the beginning of my web development journey (mid-2019), I was practicing my knowledge of HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap by building simple websites. I asked my friend what my next website should be, to which she answered, "make a boosting website for Overwatch" (a videogame we were both playing at the time). 

Overboost originally started out as a frontend project, but after researching *real* company websites for e-sports boosting services to inform this project's development, I noticed a glaring oversight: some of these websites didn't offer crucial user experience elements, such as account registration, profile creation, and live chat options. Failure to create such essential features could be the deciding factor for a potential customer to forgo their business in lieu of a competitor's business. Thus began my journey into backend development.

After a couple months of learning about server and database creation, I'm happy to report that the (encrypted and secure) account registration and login functionality of this project are now live. As I continue to delve into backend development, my intent is to gradually add more features including file uploads, a live chat app, and maybe even electronic payment options. The sky is the limit, and I'm excited to continue learning by building upon this project!
